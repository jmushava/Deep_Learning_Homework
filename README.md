## Evaluate the performance of each model

### Conclusion

*Using the testing data, evaluate each model and compare the performance.*

1. Which model has a lower loss?

   **The closing price predictor model has a lower loss than the FNG predictor model.**

2. Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

    **The closing price predictor model tracks the actual values better over time.**

3. Which window size works best for the model?

      * FNG 10-day window loss = 0.0816; Closing 10 day window loss = 0.0146

      * FNG 5-day window loss = 0.0756; Closing 5 day window loss = 0.0045

      * FNG 2 day window loss = 0.0748; Closing; 2 day window loss = 0.0077

    **Based on the results above, the 2 day window size works best for the model.**
